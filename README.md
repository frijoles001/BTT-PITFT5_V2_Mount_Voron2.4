# BTT-PITFT5_V2_Mount_Voron2.4

Mount for [Big Tree Tech PI TFT 5 Inch V2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F1WMQ1J/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_X6HDGQYNXN14MC008QEW?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) for the Voron 2.4, using 2.2 mount. 
You will need a [longer ribbon cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I6LJ19G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), for example.  Make sure it is long enough to reach your Raspberry Pi.

Thank you to OrkusMG for doing most of this work for a different screen. 
I modified it to work on the BTT V2 screen.<br>[Link to his original project](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/legacy_printers/printer_mods/OrkusMG/Waveshare5inchHDMILCDscreenCover)
Another thank you to smaseface who did a similar mod for the V1 screen. 
I edited the original OrkusMG step file but modeled mine based off of the smaseface mod but updated to fit the V2 screen.<br>[Link to his original project](https://github.com/smaseface/BTT-PITFT5-Mount-for-Voron-v2.4)
These edits include access to the screen brightness wheel, access to the reset button and (just barely) access to the inverter switch.
I recommend testing the screen before final assembly as it's difficult to get to the inverter switch once assembled (you can switch it one way using a toothpick -- just barely).

My assembled picture shows the reset button access hole off by 2.5mm, this is corrected in the final model I just didn't have a picture.

update: edit by allenrowand added to account for screen variances/clearance;   specifically the white connector between the direction switch and reset button .  Thanks!
